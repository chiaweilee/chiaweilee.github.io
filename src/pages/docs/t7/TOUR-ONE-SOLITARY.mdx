# TOUR ONE SOLITARY
## BANGKOK 1

<HotelNights date={'2013-10-8'} nights={4} />

_Bangkok, good-time city. Gateway to Southeast Asia. Where dollars and Duetsmarks get turned into counterfeit watches and genuine scars._

_"You need somewhere to stay?"_

_"I'll be Ok, thanks."_

_"What do you want? Sell passport? Tickets? You want silk? I'll take you to the best silk place? Diamonds? Come with me, get presents for girlfriend. Maybe no girlfriend. You want a girl, no problem. Good time. Boy girl <Cryptor>1d20ecdabeb25d</Cryptor> no problem..."_

_I was traveling alone. Being alone allows me more opportunity to absorb your experience on your person level._

_- The Beach, 2000_

## SUKHOTHAI 1

Baan Rim Klong Resort

*It belongs to a very kind family.*
*Good place, just behind Tourist Center.*
*It's minutes riding to sights.*
*I rent a bike for only 50 baht.*
*Garden house with breakfast.*
*The daughter of house owner is really beautiful.*
*I still remember the golden doggy Latu and the pussy momo.*
