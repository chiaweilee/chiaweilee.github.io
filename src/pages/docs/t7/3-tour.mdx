_You are far from home._
_You meet a girl._
_It's exciting, why not?_
_You are attracted to her - it's in your eyes._
_Perhaps in hers as well._
_So you think something might happen; it's easy to believe, it's exciting._
_But she has a boyfriend so you are jealous._

_Just visible through the net is the outline of two human forms entwined._
