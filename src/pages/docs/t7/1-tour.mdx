# TOUR SOLITARY

## BANGKOK 1

_Bangkok, good-time city. Gateway to Southeast Asia. Where dollars and Duetsmarks get turned into counterfeit watches and genuine scars._

_"You need somewhere to stay?"_

_"I'll be Ok, thanks."_

_"What do you want? Sell passport? Tickets? You want silk? I'll take you to the best silk place? Diamonds? Come with me, get presents for girlfriend. Maybe no girlfriend. You want a girl, no problem. Good time. Boy girl fucking no problem..."_

_I was traveling alone for two
reasons. First of all, being alone
allows you more opportunity to
absorb your experiences on a
personal level._
_Secondly, and this
I felt acutely at that moment,
there was no one who wanted to go
with me._

_What are you doing in thailand? Tourist? You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy. Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world._

_- The Beach, 2000_

## SUKHOTHAI

Bus stop in downtown, I head to songthaew.
I asked a discount to ancient city, driver said yes.
After, he told dropping me off at old town east.
I insist take off at Tourist Information Center in the north.
I don't remembered did he really give me discount, and I believe not.

I saw no resorts around.
I went to a snack waggon for asking road.

"Just go ahead from this road, then turn right.",
a man with thai style uniform answered.

"Thank you." I said.

"I drive you there."

I respectfully declined, but he insist.
I was thinking of what if he ask me a high price.

"Are you a policeman?" I questioned on the car.

"No, I am a teacher."

Scouts I saw when I arrived.
It should be what he teach I think.

Soon, I arrived.

### SARA

I'm told that most single girls here are looking for Farangs,
thai girls learn about "Farangs" when they are small.
If one finds a Farangs boyfriend or husband, who is willing to pay on her behalf.
She can build a big house back home. A "Farangs" is a simply a "sugar daddy" to them.

#### BAIYOKE SUITE HOTEL

I can't sleep.
I lies on the bed, listening to the sound of upstairs engaging in noisy sex.
He and his Thai girl did keep me awake. That's Ok, he's on holiday.
I just has time to enjoy the "silence" after turning air-conditioning and television on.
Then they reach the climax of their activity and fall silent.
