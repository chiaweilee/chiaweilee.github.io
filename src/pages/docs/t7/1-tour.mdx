# TOUR SOLITARY

## BANGKOK 1

_Bangkok, good-time city. Gateway to Southeast Asia. Where dollars and Duetsmarks get turned into counterfeit watches and genuine scars._

_"You need somewhere to stay?"_

_"I'll be Ok, thanks."_

_"What do you want? Sell passport? Tickets? You want silk? I'll take you to the best silk place? Diamonds? Come with me, get presents for girlfriend. Maybe no girlfriend. You want a girl, no problem. Good time. Boy girl fucking no problem..."_

_I was traveling alone for two
reasons. First of all, being alone
allows you more opportunity to
absorb your experiences on a
personal level._
_Secondly, and this
I felt acutely at that moment,
there was no one who wanted to go
with me._

_What are you doing in thailand? Tourist? You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy. Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world._

_- The Beach, 2000_

Bus stop in downtown, I head to songthaew.
I asked a discount to ancient city, driver said yes.
After, he told dropping me off at old town east.
I insist take off at Tourist Information Center in the north.
I don't remembered did he really give me discount, and I believe not.

I saw no resorts around.
I went to a snack waggon for asking road.

"Just go ahead from this road, then turn right.",
a man with thai style uniform answered.

"Thank you." I said.

"I drive you there."

I respectfully declined, but he insist.
I was thinking of what if he ask me a high price.

"Are you a policeman?" I questioned on the car.

"No, I am a teacher."

Scouts I saw when I arrived.
It should be what he teach I think.

Soon, I arrived.

### Baan Rim Klong Resort

<C.HotelNights date={'2013-10-12'} nights={2} />

_It belongs to a very kind family._
_Good place, just behind The Tourist Center._
_Minutes' riding to sights._
_I rent a bike for only 50 baht._
_Garden house with breakfast._
_The daughter of house owner is really beautiful._
_I still remember the golden doggy Latu and the pussy Momo._

_- My review on agoda.com_

After meal, the day just black out. And I can't recognize the way back in the black. The sense of direction told me I should ride to north. And I am far away from main road.

There's no light on the road, also my bike. I ride with feeling, and ride faster in the black. Tons of flies hit my face, and I tasted some. After crossing, I feel a river beside me, like a square river. The Wat Phrapai Luang I am confident.

I met motorbike with a beam headlight riding opposite me that I believe which win't see me. So I have to stop my bike beside the road.

At the cross, I saw fireflies, two or three. Not light in the dark, but beautiful.

### SARA

I'm told that most single girls here are looking for Farangs,
thai girls learn about "Farangs" when they are small.
If one finds a Farangs boyfriend or husband, who is willing to pay on her behalf.
She can build a big house back home. A "Farangs" is a simply a "sugar daddy" to them.

### LUCKY

## PHUKET 1

### PATONG

### PHUKET TOWN

### SIRI

It's the last day I stay in Phuket, it heavy rained in the morning,
and the wind below to East which mean planes will not landing at beach side.
Even though, I plan to walking to airport, for photos of plane.

I hide under my umbrella, elude the strong wind.

Rain stopped, wind direction changed! When I reached the end of the road.

I leave the road and step on sand, heading airport along the beach.
And a flood stream stopped me, my camera will die if I fall into it.

  points={['8.111834,98.302161']}

Finally, I am at the end of runway.

A A380 take off over my head, too late to get my camera.
I watched my plane radar app and waiting for landing.
I got some plane photos, include a beautiful B747.
And the sky just went to warming and shinning.

I did it by perseverance.

## BANGKOK 2

### PRATUNAM 2

#### BAIYOKE SUITE HOTEL

I can't sleep.
I lies on the bed, listening to the sound of upstairs engaging in noisy sex.
He and his Thai girl did keep me awake. That's Ok, he's on holiday.
I just has time to enjoy the "silence" after turning air-conditioning and television on.
Then they reach the climax of their activity and fall silent.
