# TOUR 1 SOLITARY
## BANGKOK 1

<HotelNights date={'2013-10-8'} nights={4} />

_Bangkok, good-time city. Gateway to Southeast Asia. Where dollars and Duetsmarks get turned into counterfeit watches and genuine scars._

_"You need somewhere to stay?"_

_"I'll be Ok, thanks."_

_"What do you want? Sell passport? Tickets? You want silk? I'll take you to the best silk place? Diamonds? Come with me, get presents for girlfriend. Maybe no girlfriend. You want a girl, no problem. Good time. Boy girl <Cryptor>1d20ecdabeb25d</Cryptor> no problem..."_

_I was traveling alone. Being alone allows me more opportunity to absorb your experience on your person level._

_- The Beach, 2000_

## SUKHOTHAI 1

## Unexpected

Bus stop in downtown, I head to songthaew.
I asked a discount to ancient city, driver said yes.
After, he told dropping me off at old town east.
I insist take off at Tourist Information Center in the north.
I don't remembered did he really give me discount, and I believe not.
Unpleasure experience.

TIC is big square, and I saw no resorts around.
I asked road to a aunt who own a snack waggon.

"Just go ahead from this road, then turn right.",
a man with thai style uniform answered.

"Thank you." I said.

"I drive you there."

I respectfully declined, but he insist.
That is a unexpected ride from foreigner.
I got on the truck with a tense atmosphere,
and I was thinking of what if asking me a high price at the end.

"Are you a policeman?"

"No, I am a teacher."

Scouts I saw when I arrived.
It should be what he teach I think.

The truck drive straightly and turn right at the first intersection.
Not more than 5 minutes.

### Baan Rim Klong Resort

<HotelNights date={'2013-10-12'} nights={2} />

*It belongs to a very kind family.*
*Good place, just behind Tourist Center.*
*It's minutes riding to sights.*
*I rent a bike for only 50 baht.*
*Garden house with breakfast.*
*The daughter of house owner is really beautiful.*
*I still remember the golden doggy Latu and the pussy momo.*
