## KOH PAHNAGAN 1

I found a camera in the sand. I asked around, it belongs to nobody. I danced and hang camera over my head. Later, a guy found me, it's his camera. I asked him to check photos in the camera. "Yes, they are!", These must be his important memories.

Next morning, where the music from the beach party is audible, a couple that we should be danced in the party found me. "It's him...a good guy who found a camera..." The guy told her girlfriend. We took photos, and they should uploaded. Unfortunately, I never found it.
