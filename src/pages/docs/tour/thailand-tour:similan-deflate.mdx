## Deflate

Flood in thailand. It blow strong wind on the sea. Our boat Manta Queen 1 have limit choice.
We heading Koh Tachai -- The Dome again.

We found waves on the surface, we have been told it is a "negative entry descent".
I jump into waves and touch line, but there's the old german, our guide Sergio Cruz Alvarez and me.
But Wang Meng is far away from us. We shout and he didn't response, I believe he shocked.
He is rolling into the waves, and wave push he to a boat.
It's dangerous! Sergio decide to save him.

The wave is quite strong, the german and I struggled to hang on the line, then we lost sight of Meng and Sergio.

Then a girl who should be on another boat came from nowhere, hanging on the line too.

A guy on boat shout to us, and we found out boat is toward us.
We've been picked up to the deck, and Meng and Sergio is there.
The girl will be transport to her boat, and we decide to jump again.
