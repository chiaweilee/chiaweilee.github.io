## -20â„ƒ

I put on my heavy tripod on my trip to EMei.
I found I forget to take my tripod plate till I reached the top.

It start heavy snow at sunset.
I feel disappoint, but I still set my alert clock to 3AM.

When I wake up and look out, no one outside, and snow is just stopped.
There's a layer of thin ice on the ground, it sound when I step on it.

I arrive at place and set up my tripod with hand steady.
I stand there till daybreak.
The wind is piercing and temperature is under -20.

It's pity to get a shaky photo, it direct impact "The Check List" I used then.
