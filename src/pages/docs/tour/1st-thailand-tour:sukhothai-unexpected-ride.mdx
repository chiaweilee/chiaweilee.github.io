## Unexpected Ride

Early morning of Bangkok, the only time I called tutu driver hotel downstairs riding to Mo Chit Bus Terminal.
Carry on the long-distance after taking sandwich provide from bus.

The bus reached downtown only, songthaew is the way to old city.
I asked a discount from a driver, and he promised.
He told me don't tell to the foreigner couple,
and I said "I don't know" when they ask the price the driver give me.
The driver don't drive me to the place and want to drop me off at the gate, the tourist information center I insist.
And I don't remembered did he really give me discount and I believe not.
Not a pleasure experience from this driver.

There's a square right by the center.
And a aunt's snack waggon I found.
I bought some to feed myself.
"Where is this resort?, I asked the aunt.
"Just go ahead from this road, then turn right.", a man with thai style uniform answered.
I thought he's a local policeman.

"Thank you." I said. Abruptly, "I drive you there" he stopped me.
I respectfully declined, but he insist.
That is a unexpected ride from foreigner.
I got on the truck with a tense atmosphere,
and I was thinking of what to do if he asked me a high ride price or something on the end of trip.

"Are you a policeman?" I asked. "No, I am a teacher." he said.
Scouts I saw when I arrived. It should be what he teach I think.

The truck drive straightly and turn right at the first intersection. Not more than 5 minutes, I am there.

What a nice guy, isn't is? And he's not the only nice guy I met.
