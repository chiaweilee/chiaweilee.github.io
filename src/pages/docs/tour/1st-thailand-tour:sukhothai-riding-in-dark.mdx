## Riding in dark

After meal, the day just black out. And I can't recognize the way back in the black.
The sense of direction told me I should ride to north.
And I am far away from main road.

There's no light on the road, also my bike.
I ride with feeling, and ride faster in the black.
Tons of flies hit my face, and I tasted some.
After crossing, I feel a river beside me, like a square river.
The Wat Phrapai Luang I am confident.

I met a shining motorbike opposite riding from me, I believe they can not see me.
So I have to stop my bike beside the road.

At the cross, I saw fireflies, two or three. Not light in the dark, but beautiful.
