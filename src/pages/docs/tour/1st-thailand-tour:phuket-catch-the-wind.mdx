## Catch the Wind

It's the last day I stay in Phuket, it heavy rained in the morning.
Even though, I plan to walking to airport, for photos of plane.

I hidden under my umbrella, elude the strong wind, cross the inflow of flood.
I reached the beach at the end of runway.

Rain stopped.
A A380 cross my head, too late to get my camera.
I wait there and watch my plane radar app.
I got some plane photos, include a beautiful B747.
And the sky just went to warming and shinning.

I did it by perseverance.
