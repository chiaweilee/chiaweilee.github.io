# TOUR 1 SOLITARY
## BANGKOK 1

<HotelNights date={'2013-10-8'} nights={4} />

_Bangkok, good-time city. Gateway to Southeast Asia. Where dollars and Duetsmarks get turned into counterfeit watches and genuine scars._

_"You need somewhere to stay?"_

_"I'll be Ok, thanks."_

_"What do you want? Sell passport? Tickets? You want silk? I'll take you to the best silk place? Diamonds? Come with me, get presents for girlfriend. Maybe no girlfriend. You want a girl, no problem. Good time. Boy girl <Cryptor>1d20ecdabeb25d</Cryptor> no problem..."_

_I was traveling alone. Being alone allows me more opportunity to absorb your experience on your person level._

_- The Beach, 2000_

## SUKHOTHAI 1

## Unexpected

The bus reached SUKHOTHAI downtown only, songthaew is the way to old city.
I asked a discount from a driver, and he said yes.
He told me don't tell to the foreigner couple, and I said "I don't know" when they ask the price the driver give me.
The driver don't drive me to the place, he want to drop me off at the gate
I insist to the tourist information center.
And I don't remembered did he really give me discount and I believe not.
Not a pleasure experience from this driver.

There's a square right by the center.
And a aunt's snack waggon I found.
I bought some to feed myself.
"Where is this resort?, I asked the aunt.
"Just go ahead from this road, then turn right.",
a man with thai style uniform answered.
I thought he's a local policeman.

"Thank you." I said.
Abruptly, "I drive you there" he stopped me.
I respectfully declined, but he insist.
That is a unexpected ride from foreigner.
I got on the truck with a tense atmosphere,
and I was thinking of what to do if he asked me a high ride price or something on the end of trip.

"Are you a policeman?" I asked.
"No, I am a teacher." he said.
Scouts I saw when I arrived.
It should be what he teach I think.

The truck drive straightly and turn right at the first intersection.
Not more than 5 minutes, I am there.

What a nice guy, isn't is?
And he's not the only nice guy I met.

*It belongs to a very kind family.*
*Good place, just behind Tourist Center.*
*It's minutes riding to sights.*
*I rent a bike for only 50 baht.*
*Garden house with breakfast.*
*The daughter of house owner is really beautiful.*
