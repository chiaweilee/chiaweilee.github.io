## BANGKOK

*Bangkok, good-time city. Gateway to Southeast Asia. Where dollars and Duetsmarks get  turned into counterfeit watches and genuine scars.*

*"You need somewhere to stay?"*

*"I'll be Ok, thanks."*
        
*"What do you want? Sell passport? Tickets? You want silk? I'll take you to the best silk place? Diamonds? Come with me, get presents for girlfriend. Maybe no girlfriend. You want a girl, no problem. Good time. Boy girl fucking no problem..."*

...

*So never refuse an invitation. Never resist the unfamiliar. Never fall to be polite. Never outstay your welcome. Just keep your mind open and suck in the experience. And if hurts itâ€™s probably worth it.*
