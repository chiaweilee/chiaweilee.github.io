You're waiting for a train,
a train that will take you far away...
You know where you hope this train will take you,
but you can't know for sure!
But it doesn't matter!
Now tell me why!
Because we'll be together!

So do you want to take a leap of faith,
or become an old man,
filled with regret,
waiting to die alone? 

I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.
Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.
I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate.
All those moments will be lost in time.
Like tears in rain.
Time to die.
